# Wifi-Crack

## The Wifi-Crack program has 2 attack modes.

#### Handshake attack
The Handshake attack mode, where we can obtain a valid handshake with which later we can apply brute force attack to obtain the Wi-Fi password.

#### PKMID Attack
PKMID Attack mode which focuses its attention on wireless networks that do not have associated clients.
